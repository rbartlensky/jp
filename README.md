# jp -- Json Parser

This is my attempt at creating a JSON validator in C.

## Future work

* Backtraces (why/where did it fail?)
* Better parsing (stop making use of recursive functions, better parsing
techniques, etc.)

## Why another validator?

Learn about parsing, and practice my C skills.

## Why C?

I am writing a lot of Rust code, and I've always wanted to learn C. Might also
implement this in Rust and compare the two implementations performance wise.
